Overview
This project is designed to detect and interpret sign language gestures using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system recognizes hand gestures and translates them into text or speech, enabling communication for individuals who use sign language.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/sign-language-detection.git
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd sign-language-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download pre-trained models (if applicable) from link to model.

Usage
Run the main script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to start the sign language detection system.

Supported Gestures
The system currently supports the following sign language gestures:

Alphabet letters (A-Z)
Basic words and phrases
Custom gestures (add instructions for defining custom gestures if applicable)
Configuration
Modify the configuration file (config.yaml) to adjust settings such as camera resolution, model thresholds, and output options.
